Determining variable type with type()
You can check what type of object is assigned to a variable using Python's built-in type() function. Common data types include:

int (for integer)
float
str (for string)
list
tuple
dict (for dictionary)
set
bool (for Boolean True/False)

Numbers:
print(444+444)
print(444*4)
print(4**4)
print(2+3**2/9)













Strings
Strings are used in Python to record text information, such as names. Strings in Python are actually a sequence, which basically means Python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence. For example, Python understands the string "hello' to be a sequence of letters in a specific order. This means we will be able to use indexing to grab particular letters (like the first letter, or the last letter).

This idea of a sequence is an important one in Python and we will touch upon it later on in the future.

In this lecture we'll learn about the following:

Creating a String
To create a string in Python you need to use either single quotes or double quotes. For example
